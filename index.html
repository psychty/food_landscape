            <h1>An analysis to support the understanding food landscapes in West Sussex.</h1>
            <p>This analyses brings together publicly available datsets to primarily support work on nutrition and obesity in West Sussex. Many of the datasets are reproduced here under the terms of the Open Government Licence v.3.0. Other data sources are specified throughtout the report.</p>

            <h4>Concepts of deserts and swamps</h4>
            <p>A food desert is a term often used to describe areas where people experience physical (e.g. transport) and economic barriers to accessing affordable, healthy and quality food (Shaw, 2006). This can be the absence of outlets or absence of means to get to and retrieve food supplies.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, neighbourhoods with a greater availability of high-calorie and rapid service food are often described as food swamps. Indicators of food swamps have been argued as stronger indicators of obesity than the unavailability in food deserts (Cooksey-Stowers, 2017).</p>
            <p>In the UK, there are several data sets relating to food outlets from a food standards perspective that can be leveraged to consider availability of food alongside measures of healthy weight, nutrition and obesity.</p>

                <h3>The impact of COVID-19</h3>
                <p>Some of the datasets described in this report were collected prior to the COVID-19 global pandemic. We know that the pandemic changed the way we live our lives and global supply chains and services have had to adapt to protect consumers.</p>
                <p>The pandemic brought about spikes in demand for food supplies almost overnight that demand could not keep up with initially. As people were isolating and staying away from public spaces such as shops, e-commerce and home delivery service use soared.</p>
                <p>In many ways this has helped to reduce inequalities in access to good quality food. However, not everyone has access to online services and there are still some parts of the country that are underserved.</p>

            <h1>Food businesses</h1>
            <p>In the UK, all types of food and drink businesses selling food directly to the public are required to be registered with their local authority. This includes  food businesses trading from physical customer-facing premises, from home, a mobile unit or temporary premises such as a stall of van, or through online or distance selling. Each premises must be registered with the appropriate local authority.</p>
            <p>In addition to catering services, nurseries, schools, and care homes are also required to register with the local authority if they serve food.</p>

            <p>The Food Standards Agency (FSA), an independent government department, was established in 2000 to protect public health and consumer interests in relation to food in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The organisation regulates food businesses in terms of food safety and food production standards with regards to environmental concerns and animal welfare.</p>

            <p>The FSA operates the Food Hygiene Rating Scheme (FHRS) in partnership with local authorities and provides information to the public on the hygiene standards in food premises at the time of local authority inspections to check compliance with legal requirements. The ratings information, giving a score from 0 to 5 is publicly available and premises are encouraged to display the food hygiene ratings for consumers to see. For more information on the FSA and the FHRS see the <a href = 'https://www.food.gov.uk/safety-hygiene/food-hygiene-rating-scheme'>Food Standards Agency website</a></p>

            <p class = 'good_to_know'>Businesses that are low-risk to public health, for example, newsagents, chemist shops or visitor centres selling pre-wrapped goods that do not require refrigeration and childminders and businesses that offer caring services at home may be inspected by a food safety officer at the local authority but will not recieve a food hygiene rating.</p>

            <p>As this data is openly available, we can use it to identify the food businesses operating across the county and particularly understand how fast food availability varies from area to area. <b>>As data are refreshed on the FSA website daily, this is a near real time representation of food businesses operating locally.</b></p>

            <p>The data used on this page were last extracted on the 10th June 2022.</p>

            TODO we could add other points of interest and functionality to search a postcode, draw a boundary and count the businesses

            <div class = 'good_to_know'>
                <p>The FHRS has an overall score from 0 (urgent improvement is required) to 5 (hygeine standards are very good)</p>
                <p>Ratings are a snapshot at the time of inspection and the frequency of inspections varies from around every six months to two years depending on potential public health risk, with businesses posing a higher risk inspected more frequently. Local authorities may monitor businesses in between inspections to ensure they are mainatining hygiene standards. Compaints or new information about a business can trigger investigation and an updated inspection.</p>

            <h1>Other indicators of food availability</h1>

            <h3>Adult Food Insecurity Estimates Local Authority level</h3>
            <p>The estimates draw from a survey commissioned by the Food Foundation that was conducted in Jan 2021 by YouGov and these are used to model local variation.</p> 

            <p><b>Hungry</b> is defined as having skipped food for a whole day or more in the previous month or indicated they were hungry but not eaten because they could not afford or get access to food.</p>
            <p><b>Struggle</b> is defined as a positive response to at least one of the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sought Help accessing food</li>
                <li>Skipped or shrank meal</li>
                <li>Gave a reason for not having enough food</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Worry</b> is defined as choosing very worried or fairly worried about getting food.</p>
            <h4>LA Food insecurity</h4>
            <p>The estimates are produced by Dr Angelo Moretti (MMU), Dr Adam Whitworth (Univ Sheffield) and Dr Megan Blake (Univ Sheffield) using a regression-based multilevel small area estimation methodology. </p>
            
            <h3>e-Food Deserts Index</h3>
            <p>Retail-led investment in urban areas may have largely addressed the issue of 'food deserts' . These include rapid growth of inner city and suburban 
                convenience stores operated by the major retailers, plus growth in discount retailers, the 
                latter predominantly favouring sites in proximity to relatively more deprived urban 
                communities. There has also been some recognition that groceries e-commerce (online 
                ordering of groceries for home delivery) could ‘limit the extent to which food deserts are a 
                significant problem’ (Corfe, 2018).
                Urban food deserts may therefore represent an outdated concept. By contrast, declining rural 
                service and public transport provision may be driving new inequalities in access to groceries, 
                with rural areas faring worst. This may be particularly true if these areas also lack provision of 
                groceries home delivery services. Most grocers utilise their existing store infrastructure to 
                pick, pack and deliver e-commerce orders, determining their own ‘service areas’ (the 
                geographic extent over which they are willing to deliver), usually based on travel time or 
                distance from those stores. Thus the availability of groceries e-commerce home deliveries 
                isn’t uniform, with consumers in some (predominantly remote and rural) neighbourhoods 
                less-able to benefit from these services.
                A new form of ‘e-food desert’ may therefore be emerging: remote and rural catchments with 
                poor ‘access’ to groceries home delivery services. These catchments are already the most 
                remote from physical store provision and may also be faced with withdrawal of physical 
                (retail) services. The e-Food Deserts Index (EFDI) was developed to re-assess the presence of 
                food deserts across Great Britain, accounting for novel notions of groceries home delivery 
                provision. 
                It ranks rank small areas (LSOAs1) across Great Britain according to the degree to which these 
                neighbourhoods experience characteristics associated with poor access to groceries, 
                accounting for the physical and online supply sides and consumers’ underlying demographic 
                and socio-economic characteristics.</p>
                <p>The final index enables LSOAs/DZs to be ranked or grouped into deciles, with lower ranks and 
                    decile groupings reflecting that an area exhibits more characteristics typically associated with 
                    food deserts. Due to slight differences in some of the accessibility measures in the Transport 
                    and Accessibility domain between England & Wales and Scotland, it is not possible to directly 
                    compare EFDI scores or ranks between England & Wales and Scotland. 
                    In the case of Scotland, there are no direct measures of access (by car or public transport) to 
                    food stores – instead these access measures are reported only for ‘retail centres’ which are 
                    larger clusters of stores and don’t account for stand-alone food stores. These access measures
                    still provide an excellent indication of relative accessibility of retail services between LSOAs 
                    and enable us to generate a robust classification for Scotland. Nevertheless, this means that 
                    DZs in Scotland should not be directly compared to LSOAs in England and Wales in terms of 
                    ranks or raw scores from the EFDI. 
                    Figures 1 and 2 highlight the raw index (EFDI Scores) for England & Wales and also for 
                    Scotland, with Scotland shown separately (as outlined above). We recognise that the detail is 
                    difficult to see (especially in urban areas) and we recommend users refer to the interactive 
                    version available as part of CDRC Maps
                    We highlight that a number of major cities (including Leeds, Newcastle and Cardiff) which 
                    featured prominently in the urban food deserts debate of the late 1990s and early 2000s still 
                    exhibit considerable pockets of neighbourhoods exhibiting food desert-like characteristics. 
                    Yet we also find that contemporary food deserts are an important concept in rural areas too, 
                    driven by comparatively poorer access to physical foodstore provision in many of these 
                    localities, exacerbated by poorer coverage (at times no availability) of online groceries. 
                    We created the EFDI as a by-product of research primarily focussed on online groceries home 
                    delivery. Specifically we considered the extent to which the incorporation of online groceries 
                    delivery availability influenced food desert-like characteristics at the neighbourhood level</p>
            <p>The e-food desert index (EFDI) is a small area (LSOA) indicator measuring the extent to which neighbourhoods exhibit characteristics associated with food deserts across four key drivers of groceries accessibility:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Proximity and density of grocery retail facilities</li>
    <li>Transport and accessibility</li>
    <li>Neighbourhood socio-economic and demographic characteristics</li>
    <li>E-commerce availability and propensity</li>
</ul>
               
<p>The index was created in 2018, so is a few years out of date and does not take into account the substantial changes to online grocery provision (home deliveries) resulting from the COVID-19 global pandemic.</p>
