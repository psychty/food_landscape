            <h1>An analysis to support the understanding food landscapes in West Sussex</h1>
            <p>This analyses brings together publicly available datsets to primarily support work on nutrition and obesity in West Sussex. Many of the datasets are reproduced here under the terms of the Open Government Licence v.3.0. Other data sources are specified throughtout the report. The analyses contained here was created by Dr Rich Tyler, and Dr Verity Pinkney, of the West Sussex Public Health and Social Research Unit.</p>

            <h4>Concepts of deserts and swamps</h4>
            <p>A food desert is a term often used to describe areas where people experience physical (e.g. transport) and economic barriers to accessing affordable, healthy and quality food (Shaw, 2006). This can be the absence of outlets or absence of means to get to and retrieve food supplies.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, neighbourhoods with a greater availability of high-calorie and rapid service food are often described as food swamps. Indicators of food swamps have been argued as stronger indicators of obesity than the unavailability in food deserts (Cooksey-Stowers, 2017).</p>
            <p>In the UK, there are several data sets relating to food outlets from a food standards perspective that can be leveraged to consider availability of food alongside measures of healthy weight, nutrition and obesity.</p>

              <h3>The impact of COVID-19</h3>
              <p>Some of the datasets described in this report were collected prior to the COVID-19 global pandemic. We know that the pandemic changed the way we live our lives and global supply chains and services have had to adapt to protect consumers.</p>
              <p>The pandemic brought about spikes in demand for food supplies almost overnight that demand could not keep up with initially. As people were isolating and staying away from public spaces such as shops, e-commerce and home delivery service use soared.</p>
              <p>In many ways this has helped to reduce inequalities in access to good quality food. However, not everyone has access to online services and there are still some parts of the country that are underserved.</p>

            <h1>Food businesses</h1>
            <p>In the UK, all types of food and drink businesses selling food directly to the public are required to be registered with their local authority. This includes food businesses trading from physical customer-facing premises, from home, a mobile unit, or temporary premises such as a stall or van, or through online selling. Each premises must be registered with the appropriate local authority. In addition to catering services, nurseries, schools, and care homes are also required to register with the local authority if they serve food.</p>

            <p>The Food Standards Agency (FSA), an independent government department, was established in 2000 to protect public health and consumer interests in relation to food in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The organisation regulates food businesses in terms of food safety and food production standards.</p>

            <p>The FSA operates the Food Hygiene Rating Scheme (FHRS) in partnership with local authorities and provides overall ratings results to the public as at the time of local authority inspections to check compliance with legal requirements. The ratings information, giving a score from 0 to 5 is publicly available and premises are encouraged to display the food hygiene ratings for consumers to see. For more information on the FSA and the FHRS see the <a href = 'https://www.food.gov.uk/safety-hygiene/food-hygiene-rating-scheme'>Food Standards Agency website</a></p>

            <!-- <p class = 'good_to_know'>Businesses that are low-risk to public health such as newsagents, chemist shops or visitor centres selling pre-wrapped non-refrigerated goods and childminders and businesses that offer caring services at home may be inspected by a food safety officer at the local authority but will not recieve a food hygiene rating.</p> -->

 <p>Data collected include the geographical coordinates, inspection score, and business type of all businesses/premises where food is consumed, sold or provided. As this data is openly available, we can use it to identify the food businesses operating across the county and particularly understand how food availability varies from area to area. <b>As data are refreshed on the FSA website daily, this is a near real time representation of food businesses operating locally.</b></p>

<p>The data used on this page were last extracted on the 15th June 2022.</p>

<p>The table below shows the number of FHRS inspected premises in each local authority in West Sussex by business type.</p>

<h4>Table of premises inspected by local authority and food business type.</h4>

<p class = 'caption'>Note: this included premises registered to the local authority without any geolocation information about where the business operates.</p>

<h4>Recreating 'fast food density' mapping</h4>
<p>In 2018, the then Public Health England used FSA data on inspections to analyse the density of 'fast food' outlets at lower tier local authority and ward level, and they showed that deprived local authorities had a greater density of outlets compared to less deprived areas.</p>

<div class="good_to_know">
    <p>PHE's 2018 inclusion criteria were:</p>
    <dl><dt>any takeaway/sandwich shop</dt>
        <dt>any restaurant/cafe/canteen, mobile caterer, or other catering presmises whose name contains one of the following key terms: </dt>
        <dd>"burger", "chicken", "chip", "fish bar", "pizza", "kebab", "india", "china", "chinese"</dd>

        <dt>any restaurant, retailer (supermarket/hypermarker or other) or school/college/university premises whose business name was one of eight major chains (names of the chains were not available).</dt>
    </dl>
        
</div>

<p>We have updated this analyses using the FSA data source as at June 2022, and combined it with 2020 population estimates and 2019 area deprivation information at lower layer super super output area level (LSOA). As the major chains included in the analyses were not identified, we have chosen a set of chains we believe represent the top businesses operating 'fast food' outlets in 2022. This was done through searching the FSA data.</p>

<p>The original authors note several caveats and limitations which are also applicable to the update.</p>

<p>The term 'fast food' means different things to different people and covers a range of outlets including burger bars, kebab and chip shops and sandwich shops. The culture and popularity of eating different cuisines, including an increase in mobile catering or 'food trucks/street food', particularly as a result of restrictions on indoor restaurants meant more people were eating food prepared in this way. Whilst mobile caterers are inspected as part of the FHRS, <b>the location in the data may not be reflective of the location(s) they serve food.</b></p>

<p>Home delivery, again heightened by the pandemic, has led to an even greater choice and availability of fast food, ordered within seconds and delivered directly to the customer. With retailers able to define the boundaries of how far they are willing to deliver food, geographical barriers may be even less relevant.</p>
    
<p>As a result, it is likely that the data does not show the complete picture for fast food outlets available in a given neighbourhood area.</p> 

<p class = good_to_know>Some cleaning of the Food Standards Agency has been conducted on the dataset to correct obvious errors in geolocation information. For example, a handfull of West Sussex premises had geocodes that placed them in other parts of the UK. However, it is possible that other errors persist and it is not possible to screen every record. Geolocation within West Sussex was available for around 75% of premesis recorded on the FHRS snapshot as registered to one of the seven district and boroughs in the county. Overall, the FHRS dataset from FSA is considered robust for spacial analysis (Kirkman et al, 2021) despite up to a quarter of premises being unavailable.</p>

                <p>'Fast food' means different things to different people. For example, it is sometimes associated with a particular type of food. In this instance 'fast food' refers to food that is energy dense and available quickly, therefore it covers a range of outlets that include, but are not limited to, burger bars, kebab and chicken shops, chip shops and pizza outlets.</p>
                <p>However,mMany of the outlets that could be considered 'fast food' are likely to be multi-functional with dine in, takeaway, and home delivery with vast menus covering other 'healthy foods'. As a result, businesses may have been recorded under the category of restaurant or café which would mean they may not have been included in the analsyses based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria used.</p>

            <h1>Other indicators of food availability</h1>

            <h3>Adult Food Insecurity Estimates Local Authority level</h3>
            <p>The estimates draw from a survey commissioned by the Food Foundation that was conducted in Jan 2021 by YouGov and these are used to model local variation.</p> 

            <p><b>Hungry</b> is defined as having skipped food for a whole day or more in the previous month or indicated they were hungry but not eaten because they could not afford or get access to food.</p>
            <p><b>Struggle</b> is defined as a positive response to at least one of the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sought Help accessing food</li>
                <li>Skipped or shrank meal</li>
                <li>Gave a reason for not having enough food</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Worry</b> is defined as choosing very worried or fairly worried about getting food.</p>
            <h4>LA Food insecurity</h4>
            <p>The estimates are produced by Dr Angelo Moretti (MMU), Dr Adam Whitworth (Univ Sheffield) and Dr Megan Blake (Univ Sheffield) using a regression-based multilevel small area estimation methodology. </p>
            
            <h3>e-Food Deserts Index</h3>
            <p>Retail-led investment in urban areas may have largely addressed the issue of 'food deserts' by rapid growth of inner city and suburban convenience stores operated by the major retailers in recent decades, alongside the growth in discount retailers. However, public transport provision in more rural areas may drive new inequalities in access to groceries.</p>
            <p>Whilst e-commerce (online ordering for home delivery) has been suggested to reduce the impact of food deserts (Corfe, 2018), most grocers utilise their existing infrastructure to pick, pack and deliver orders, determining the geographic extent over which they are willing to deliver.</p>
            <p>Moreover, consumers need to be able to access methods to order their groceries online, such as a computer or mobile phone and an internet connection.</p>    
            <p>As a result, home deliveries are not accessible universally with consumers in some (predominantly remote and rural) neighbourhoods less-able to benefit from these services.</p>
              
            <p>The e-food desert index (EFDI) is a small area (LSOA) indicator measuring the extent to which neighbourhoods exhibit characteristics associated with food deserts across four key drivers of groceries accessibility:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Proximity and density of grocery retail facilities</li>
    <li>Transport and accessibility</li>
    <li>Neighbourhood socio-economic and demographic characteristics</li>
    <li>E-commerce availability and propensity</li>
</ul>
               
<p>The index was created in 2018, so is a few years out of date and does not take into account the substantial changes, and improvements, to online grocery provision (home deliveries) resulting from the COVID-19 global pandemic.</p>
