            <h1>An analysis to support the understanding food landscapes in West Sussex.</h1>
            <p>This analyses brings together publicly available datsets to primarily support work on nutrition and obesity in West Sussex. Many of the datasets are reproduced here under the terms of the Open Government Licence v.3.0. Other data sources are specified throughtout the report.</p>

            <h4>Concepts of deserts and swamps</h4>
            <p>A food desert is a term often used to describe areas where people experience physical (e.g. transport) and economic barriers to accessing affordable, healthy and quality food (Shaw, 2006). This can be the absence of outlets or absence of means to get to and retrieve food supplies.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, neighbourhoods with a greater availability of high-calorie and rapid service food are often described as food swamps. Indicators of food swamps have been argued as stronger indicators of obesity than the unavailability in food deserts (Cooksey-Stowers, 2017).</p>
            <p>In the UK, there are several data sets relating to food outlets from a food standards perspective that can be leveraged to consider availability of food alongside measures of healthy weight, nutrition and obesity.</p>

                <h3>The impact of COVID-19</h3>
                <p>Some of the datasets described in this report were collected prior to the COVID-19 global pandemic. We know that the pandemic changed the way we live our lives and global supply chains and services have had to adapt to protect consumers.</p>
                <p>The pandemic brought about spikes in demand for food supplies almost overnight that demand could not keep up with initially. As people were isolating and staying away from public spaces such as shops, e-commerce and home delivery service use soared.</p>
                <p>In many ways this has helped to reduce inequalities in access to good quality food. However, not everyone has access to online services and there are still some parts of the country that are underserved.</p>

            <h1>Food businesses</h1>
            <p>In the UK, all types of food and drink businesses selling food directly to the public are required to be registered with their local authority. This includes  food businesses trading from physical customer-facing premises, from home, a mobile unit or temporary premises such as a stall of van, or through online or distance selling. Each premises must be registered with the appropriate local authority.</p>
            <p>In addition to catering services, nurseries, schools, and care homes are also required to register with the local authority if they serve food.</p>

            <p>The Food Standards Agency (FSA), an independent government department, was established in 2000 to protect public health and consumer interests in relation to food in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The organisation regulates food businesses in terms of food safety and food production standards with regards to environmental concerns and animal welfare.</p>

            <p>The FSA operates the Food Hygiene Rating Scheme (FHRS) in partnership with local authorities and provides information to the public on the hygiene standards in food premises at the time of local authority inspections to check compliance with legal requirements. The ratings information, giving a score from 0 to 5 is publicly available and premises are encouraged to display the food hygiene ratings for consumers to see. For more information on the FSA and the FHRS see the <a href = 'https://www.food.gov.uk/safety-hygiene/food-hygiene-rating-scheme'>Food Standards Agency website</a></p>

            <p class = 'good_to_know'>Businesses that are low-risk to public health, for example, newsagents, chemist shops or visitor centres selling pre-wrapped goods that do not require refrigeration and childminders and businesses that offer caring services at home may be inspected by a food safety officer at the local authority but will not recieve a food hygiene rating.</p>

            <p>Data collected include the geographical coordinates, inspection score, and business type of all businesses/premises where food is consumed, sold or provided. As this data is openly available, we can use it to identify the food businesses operating across the county and particularly understand how food availability varies from area to area. <b>As data are refreshed on the FSA website daily, this is a near real time representation of food businesses operating locally.</b></p>

            <p>The data used on this page were last extracted on the 10th June 2022.</p>

<!-- <p>The term 'fast food' means different things to different people and covers a range of outlets that include, but are not limited to, burger bars, kebab and chip shops and sandwich shops. It is likely that the data does not show the complete picture for fast food outlets. Many of the outlets that could be considered 'fast food' are likely to be multi-functional; sit-down and eat in, takeaway and home delivery.</p> -->
<p>As a result businesses may have been recorded under the category of restaurant or caf√© which would mean they are not considered here despite selling similar types of food to those included in this analysis.</p>

<p class = good_to_know>Some cleaning of the Food Standards Agency has been conducted on the dataset to correct obvious errors in geolocation information. For example, a handfull of West Sussex premises had geocodes that placed them in other parts of the UK. However, it is possible that other errors persist and it is not possible to screen every record. Overall, the FHRS dataset from FSA is considered robust for spacial analysis (Kirkman et al, 2021) despite .</p>

            TODO we could add other points of interest and functionality to search a postcode, draw a boundary and count the businesses
            We could include LSOA level information, in a table or map that has pop density and number or premises.

            <div class = 'good_to_know'>
                <p>The FHRS has an overall score from 0 (urgent improvement is required) to 5 (hygeine standards are very good)</p>
                <p>Ratings are a snapshot at the time of inspection and the frequency of inspections varies from around every six months to two years depending on potential public health risk, with businesses posing a higher risk inspected more frequently. Local authorities may monitor businesses in between inspections to ensure they are mainatining hygiene standards. Compaints or new information about a business can trigger investigation and an updated inspection.</p>

            <h1>Other indicators of food availability</h1>

            <h3>Adult Food Insecurity Estimates Local Authority level</h3>
            <p>The estimates draw from a survey commissioned by the Food Foundation that was conducted in Jan 2021 by YouGov and these are used to model local variation.</p> 

            <p><b>Hungry</b> is defined as having skipped food for a whole day or more in the previous month or indicated they were hungry but not eaten because they could not afford or get access to food.</p>
            <p><b>Struggle</b> is defined as a positive response to at least one of the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sought Help accessing food</li>
                <li>Skipped or shrank meal</li>
                <li>Gave a reason for not having enough food</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Worry</b> is defined as choosing very worried or fairly worried about getting food.</p>
            <h4>LA Food insecurity</h4>
            <p>The estimates are produced by Dr Angelo Moretti (MMU), Dr Adam Whitworth (Univ Sheffield) and Dr Megan Blake (Univ Sheffield) using a regression-based multilevel small area estimation methodology. </p>
            
            <h3>e-Food Deserts Index</h3>
            <p>Retail-led investment in urban areas may have largely addressed the issue of 'food deserts' by rapid growth of inner city and suburban convenience stores operated by the major retailers in recent decades, alongside the growth in discount retailers. However, public transport provision in more rural areas may drive new inequalities in access to groceries.</p>
            <p>Whilst e-commerce (online ordering for home delivery) has been suggested to reduce the impact of food deserts (Corfe, 2018), most grocers utilise their existing infrastructure to pick, pack and deliver orders, determining the geographic extent over which they are willing to deliver.</p>
            <p>Moreover, consumers need to be able to access methods to order their groceries online, such as a computer or mobile phone and an internet connection.</p>    
            <p>As a result, home deliveries are not accessible universally with consumers in some (predominantly remote and rural) neighbourhoods less-able to benefit from these services.</p>
              
            <p>The e-food desert index (EFDI) is a small area (LSOA) indicator measuring the extent to which neighbourhoods exhibit characteristics associated with food deserts across four key drivers of groceries accessibility:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Proximity and density of grocery retail facilities</li>
    <li>Transport and accessibility</li>
    <li>Neighbourhood socio-economic and demographic characteristics</li>
    <li>E-commerce availability and propensity</li>
</ul>
               
<p>The index was created in 2018, so is a few years out of date and does not take into account the substantial changes, and improvements, to online grocery provision (home deliveries) resulting from the COVID-19 global pandemic.</p>
